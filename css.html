        <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
        <p>CSS is Cascading Style Sheet in full.</p>
        <p>CSS is a way that helps a web designer to modify a website in a way that the end user would want.</p>
        <h3>Different ways how CSS can be used in a web page.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Inline CSS - This is used in the html file in a specific tag that the designer is targeting. This is done with the styke attribute.</p></li>
            <li><p>Internal CSS - This is also in the html file but this is written in the head tag of the page using the style tag with different selectors.</p></li>
            <li><p>External CSS - This is an external file with the .css extension that contains all the different styles for all the elements. The external css is just linked to the html page that the styles have to apply to.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CSS selectors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Element tags - These are the tags of the different elements that one wants to style.</li>
            <li>Classes - Here the syntax for writitng a class in css is by using the . symbol.</li>
            <li>Ids - To identify an id the, CSS checks for the # during the styling process</li>
            <li>Note ids take more priority than classes and classes take more priority than element tags.</li>
        </ul>
